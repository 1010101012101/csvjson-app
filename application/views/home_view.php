			<h4>About CSVJSON</h4>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					As a developer, format conversion is something I sometimes have to do. I often look online for solutions and tools finding they only cover partly my needs.
				</p>
				<p>
					CSVJSON is a do-it-myself and more permanent solution. Its on <a href="https://github.com/martindrapeau/csvjson-app">Github</a> for anyone to contribute enhancements or to write new tools.
				</p>
				<p>
					Conversions are written in Javascript and performed client-side. CSVJSON is served with PHP Codeigniter.
				</p>
				<p>
					The best feature of CSVJSON? You can save your session for later, and share it with a co-worker.
				</p>
				<p>
					I hope it can be useful to you. Happy conversions!
				</p>
